ADVANTAGES:

AI would have a low error rate compared to humans, if coded properly. They would have incredible precision, accuracy, and speed.
They won't be affected by hostile environments, thus able to complete dangerous tasks, explore in space, and endure problems that would injure or kill us.
This can even mean mining and digging fuels that would otherwise be hostile for humans.
Replace humans in repetitive, tedious tasks and in many laborious places of work.
Predict what a user will type, ask, search, and do. They can easily act as assitants and cna recommend or direct various actions.
An example of this can be found in the smartphone.
Can detect fraud in card-based systems, and possibly other systems in the future.

DISADVANTAGES:
Can cost a lot of money and time to build, rebuild, and repair. Robotic repair can occur to reduce time and humans needing to fix it, but that'll cost more money and resources.
It's questionable: is it ethically and morally correct to have androids, human-like robots, or recreate intelligence, a gift of nature that shouldn't be recreated? This is a discussion about AI that's popular in the days.
Storage is expansive, but access and retrieval may not lead to connections in memory as well as humans could.
They can learn and get better with tasks if coded to, but it's questionable as to if this can ever become as good as humans can do such.
They cannot work outside of what they were programmed for.
They could never, or, at least, seemingly never with our technological perceptions, recieve creativity that humans have.
This can prevent sympathizing with emotions for human contact, such as in being nurses. This can also reduce wisdom can understanding.
